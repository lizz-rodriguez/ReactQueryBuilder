# React Query Builder UI

This project provides a React implementation of the Syniti-style layout shown in the design
reference. The right-hand panel contains an interactive query builder with nested grouping,
logical operator toggles, and controls for adding or removing conditions.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If your shell reports `Missing script: "dev"`, double-check that you're running the
commands from the project root (where `package.json` lives). You can also start the
development server with `npm start`, which proxies to the same script.

The development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server.
- `npm run build` – create a production build.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – lint the project with ESLint.
